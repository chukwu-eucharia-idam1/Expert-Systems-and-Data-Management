## Knowledge Bases vs. Databases

In the domains of Expert Systems and Machine Learning, understanding the fundamental distinctions between knowledge bases and databases is crucial.

### Knowledge Base

A knowledge base acts as a repository of domain-specific knowledge, rules, and expertise. It is the core of expert systems, containing structured information that facilitates problem-solving and decision-making. In expert systems, knowledge bases consist of rules, facts, and a reasoning engine, enabling these systems to make intelligent inferences and recommendations.

Example (CLIPS Rule):
```clips
(defrule allergy
  (symptom runny-nose)
  (symptom itchy-eyes)
  =>
  (assert (diagnosis "Allergic Rhinitis"))
```

### Database

In contrast, a database serves as a structured data repository optimized for efficient data storage, retrieval, and management. Databases store raw data and provide powerful querying capabilities, often leveraging the Structured Query Language (SQL). They are integral components in various data-driven applications.

Example (SQL Query):
```sql
SELECT product_name, price
FROM products
WHERE category = 'Electronics';
```

In summary, a knowledge base is designed for reasoning and decision-making, employing domain-specific expertise and rules. Databases, on the other hand, are tailored for structured data storage, retrieval, and efficient data management, devoid of inherent reasoning capabilities.
